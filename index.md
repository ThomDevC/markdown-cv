{:.description}
*The eighth year of my career is about to come to an end and I still have the feeling that I know nothing.*
*I obviously accumulated experiences that made I am now capable of facing some various and difficult problems, but in a world of Generative AI tools, a successful project is not a technical matter anymore. In contrast, I observed lots of communication issues though my missions, and so, I think the challenge for the IT teams will be more on the human side.*
*That's why I no longer want to be a Developper that only focuses on code, but a mindful Engineer aware that he will have to empathize with his future coworkers in order to do big things.*

## Experiences

### 10/2023 - now 
**WayKonect** - *Team Leader*

Working for a TotalEnergies subsidiary specialized in mobility services, I was the leader of a 8 people feature team.

In addition to be in charge of the technical design of the microservices, I engage myself into the project organisation and the long-term roadmap alongside with the product owner.

Thus, I succeeded in setting up a strong team spirit that conduced to high-quality continuous deliveries.

_Stack: Java 21, Spring Boot 3, Docker, Postgresql, GitHub Actions, AWS (Cloudwatch, SQS)_

### 08/2022 - 10/2023
**ADEO** - *Lead Developer*

Amongst the Supply Chain Data Platform of a French DIY retailer, I was the lead developper of the Relex Gateway team.

In collaboration with 3 junior data engineers, I made a REST API from scratch for managing Order Proposals that was computed by an external AI solution and stored in a BigQuery DataWarehouse.

As a result, the whole department delivered a new in-store app based on the API, in less than 6 months. 

_Stack: Java 17, Quarkus 3, Docker, Postgresql, GitHub Actions, GCP (BigQuery)_

### 04/2020 - 04/2022

In a context of a confidential and sensitive project, I was a developper of a internal web platform for monitoring network equipments.

_Stack: Java 11, Spring Boot 2, Postgresql, Python 3 (Danjo)_

### 01/2017 - 03/2020
**Decathlon** - *Developer*

Working for Decathlon, a well-known French retailer dedicated to conceive sport accessories, I was a developper in the Customer Invoice Team.

Included in a 5 people team, I was responsible for the ongoing maintenance of the newly built application that generates and stores de-materialized invoices, for both e-commerce and in-store transactions. 

When I quit, the app provided invoices for the new website project that was released in 7 countries and for stores in about 20 countries all over the world.

_Stack: Java 1.8, Spring (MVC, Data), Postgresql, Jenkins, AngularJS_
