## Expériences

### 2020-2021
**Kept in secret** - *Software Engineer*

In a context of a confidential project in a very sensitive field of work, I brought some improvements to an existent web platform destined for the monitoring of network equipments in order to fit the client's needs.

As Groovy was mainly used as programming language, my knowledge of Java was useful but I also had to learn some more about others like Python.
I finally was responsible for the migration of some Python scripts from version 2 to version 3, what made me want to go further and explore all the possibilities it allows.


### 2016-2020
**Econocom, Lille, Decathlon** - *Software Engineer*

Decathlon is a French retailer dedicated to conceive sporting equipment and provide it all over the world.
As a result of a new e-commerce website and fully de-materialized invoices, they built a scalable and effective REST API that grants omni-device usage.

I was first in charge of fixes and upgrades on the back-end, a three-tiers architecture Spring application.
Later on with the success of the subsequent deployments in a couple of worldwide countries, I took a step forward as Lead Developer of a five-members team.
Thus, I set up continous improvment, continuous integration and code review thanks to Sonar and Jenkins suite.

### 2016
**Sopra Steria, Brussels, European Institutions** - *Software Engineer*

The EU Institutions Business Unit of Sopra Steria was asked for making a web application that have to retrieve the identity of the asylum askeers, based on fingerprints and passport as inputs.
In tandem with a team of international remote developers specialized in European data systems, I designed an IHM that responds to UX needs in a Java environment using ZK Framework.
